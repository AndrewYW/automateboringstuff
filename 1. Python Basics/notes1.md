# Math Operators 
- ** Exponent
- % Modulus/Remainder
- // Integer division
- / Division
- \* Multiplication 
- \- Subtraction
- \+ Addition

# Expression & Statements
- **Statements** consists of a variable name, an equal sign and a value to be stored. 
- *Example* : *Sunny = 19* 
- **Expressions** Expressions consists of values. 
- *Example* : *2+2*

# Variable Names
- 1. It can be only one word.
- 2. It can use only letters, numbers and underscores. 
- 3. It cant begin with a number.
- **Example**: *sunny_k = 19*
- Make sure to start variable with lowercase letters.

# Comments
- Use hashtag # to make a comment, Python ignores comments.
- You can put a # infront of a line of code to temporarily remove it to test a program.

# The input() Function
- The input function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER.

# The len() Function
- Calculates the amount of characters in a string.
- *Example - len('sunny')*
- *5*

# The str(), int(), and float() Functions
- The **str()** function can be passed an integer value and will evaluate to a string value version of it, as follows:
- >>> str(29)
- >>> '29'
- >>> print('I am ' + str(29) + ' years old.')
- >>> I am 29 years old.

- The **int()** function is helpful if you have a number as a string value that you also want to use in Math.
- >>> spam = int(spam)
- >>> spam
- >>> 101
- Now you should be able to treat the spam variable as an integer instead of a string.
- >>> spam * 10 / 5
- >>> 202.0
