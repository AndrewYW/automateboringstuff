1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
  True and False
2. What are the three Boolean operators?
  and, or, not
3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
  True and True is True.
  True and False is False.
  False and True is False.
  False and False is False.
  True or True is True.
  True or False is True.
  False or True is True.
  False or False is False.
  not True is False.
  not False is True.
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

  (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                            F
  not (5 > 4)                                     F
  (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                             T
  not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                       F
  (True and True) and (True == False)             F
  (not False) or (not True)                       T

5. What are the six comparison operators?
    ==, !=, <=, >=, >, <
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
    == compares and evaluates to Boolean, = stores value in a variable
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
    Expression in flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean, use for decision blocks
8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

  spam = 0
  if spam == 10:                                    major block 1
      print('eggs')
      if spam > 5:
          print('bacon')                            block 2
      else:
          print('ham')                              block 3
      print('spam')
  print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

  if spam ==1:
    print('Hello')
  elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
  else:
    print('Greetings!')
10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

  CTRL-C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

  break moves the execution outside and after a loop, continue moves execution to start of loop

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

  range(10) - from 0 up to but not including 10,
  range(0,10) - explicitly tells to start at 0,
  range(0,10,1) - increase variable by 1 each iteration

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

  for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

  i = 1
  while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i+1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

  spam.bacon()
