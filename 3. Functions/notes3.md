# Functions
- The purpose of a function is to group code that gets executed multiple 
times, without this, you'd have to copy and paste this code each time.

- *deduplicating* - getting rid of duplicated or copypaste code. Easy to read & update.

# Def Statements with Parameters
- The definition of the hello() function in this program has a parameter called name ❶. A *parameter* is a variable that an argument is stored in when a function is called. The first time the hello() function is called, it’s with the argument 'Alice' ❸. The program execution enters the function, and the variable name is automatically set to 'Alice', which is what gets printed by the print() statement ❷.

# Return Values and return Statements
- When an expression is used with a *return* statement, the return value is what this expression evaluates to.

# The None Value
- *None* - Absence of a value (Other programming languages might call this value null,nil or undefined)
- *None* must be typed with a capital N.
